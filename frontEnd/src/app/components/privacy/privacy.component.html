<div class="content">When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also
  the visitor’s IP
  address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.
  An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to
  see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After
  approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

  If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies. These
  are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment.

  If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser
  accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.

  When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display
  choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select “Remember Me”,
  your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.

<p class="header3">Embedded content from other websites</p>
<div class="content">
  Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other
  websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
  These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your
  interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an
  account and are logged in to that website.

<p class="header2">How long we retain your data</p>
<div class="content">
  If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and
  approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

  For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user
  profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their
  username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.
</div>
<p class="header2">What rights you have over your data</p>
<div class="content">
  If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the
  personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any
  personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or
  security purposes.
